## Mini-description of Labwork3
The aim of Labwork 3 was to make:
- **Mobile adaptation**
- **Ability of mailing list ;**

## The personal task of Labwork1
My aim was to reconstruct the layout, which will be adequate to the rules above. Make diffferent css approaches at the main page.

### Mobile adaptation
**Responsive Design:** The CSS code includes media queries, such as `@media screen and (max-width: 768px)`, to define styles that apply specifically to screens with a width of 768 pixels or less. This is a common technique for responsive design, ensuring that the website's layout and styling adjust to different screen sizes, particularly smaller screens like those on mobile devices.

**Flexbox:** The use of the `display: flex;` property and related properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` helps in creating flexible and responsive layouts. This is particularly useful for organizing content in a structured way on both larger and smaller screens.

**Font and Text Adjustments:** The CSS code adjusts the font sizes, padding, and other text-related properties to make content more readable and visually appealing on smaller screens. For example, it reduces font sizes and padding in the mobile-specific media query to accommodate smaller screens.

**Navigation and Header Adjustments:** The navigation menu and header elements are modified to ensure they are user-friendly on mobile devices. This may include changes in font size, padding, and layout to make navigation more accessible and easier to interact with on small screens.

**Image Scaling:** Images are adjusted to be responsive by using `max-width: 100%;`. This ensures that images don't overflow their containers and maintain their proportions on different screen sizes.

**Touch Interactions:** Some elements have CSS properties like `hover` effects that are common for desktop interactions. For mobile devices, these properties may be adjusted or replaced with more touch-friendly interactions. In this code, the `.discount-icon` element, for example, scales when hovered over, which is a desktop-style interaction. On mobile, the same effect is achieved with a touch-based interaction by scaling the element when touched.

**Column Reorganization:** In the mobile-specific media query, the layout is changed to a single column to accommodate the limited screen width, making content stack vertically for improved mobile usability.

### Ability of mailing list
This code provides the structure and styling for an email, but it doesn't actually send the email. To send an email, you would need to use a server-side script or a third-party email service to handle the sending process, which is not included in the HTML code itself.
